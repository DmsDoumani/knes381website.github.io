We use a combination of medical history, physical examination, imaging tests, electromyography, pain assessment, and functional assessment to assess the severity and underlying cause of the your Sciatica symptoms.

#### 2) Patient Education 
Patient eductaion involves a one-on-one session with our provideors sitting down with you to discuss and inform you with knowledge and skills necessary to actively participate in your own recovery, prevent future injuries or pain, and help you achieve long-term success.

This session may include a discussion about self-care techniques, lifestyle modifications, medication management, home modifications, and prevention strategies.

#### 4) Curating a Treatment Plan
